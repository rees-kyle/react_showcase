                Custom hooks in React allow you to extract and reuse stateful logic across multiple components.
                They follow the same rules as standard hooks but provide a way to share logic without repeating code.
                Custom hooks are JavaScript functions that begin with the word "use," as per Reactâ€™s naming convention.
            </p>
        </div>
    );
};

export default CustomHooks;
