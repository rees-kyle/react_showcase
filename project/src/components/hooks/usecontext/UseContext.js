const UseContext = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1 className="underline">useContext</h1>
            <p>
                In React, 'useContext' is a powerful Hook for managing global state, 
                allowing data to be shared across different components without passing props down manually at each level.
                Here's a breakdown of how to use it:
            </p>
        </div>
    );
};

export default UseContext;
