      <h3>Isolate components</h3>
      <p>
        Mock external dependencies to keep tests focused and independent.
      </p>
      <h3>Keep tests simple</h3>
      <p>
        Test one behavior per case for clarity and easier debugging.
      </p>
      <h3>Use meaningful names</h3>
      <p>
        Write descriptive test names that explain whatâ€™s being tested.
