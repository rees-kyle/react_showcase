      <p>
        CSS Modules are a great way to style components in React with scoped, modular CSS.
        They allow you to write CSS thatâ€™s local to a specific component,
        preventing your styles from leaking across your app,
        and they integrate smoothly with modern React development.
      </p>
    </div>
