      <h2>Choosing Between Controlled and Uncontrolled Components</h2>
      <h3>Controlled</h3>
      <p>
        Use Controlled Components when you need to manage form data closely,
        such as for complex forms, validation, or when you want to have a clear flow of data.
      </p>

      <h3>Uncontrolled</h3>
      <p>
        Use Uncontrolled Components for simple forms or when you're integrating with third-party libraries,
        where you don't need to manage the input state actively.
      </p>
