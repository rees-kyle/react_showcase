            <p>Context API is ideal for managing global state, like theme, user authentication, or language settings.</p>
            <p>It prevents "prop drilling", where props are passed through multiple levels of components unnecessarily.</p>
            <p>It's more lightweight compared to state management libraries like Redux, making it perfect for small to medium-sized applications.</p>
